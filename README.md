# Console Kit
Console Kit is a tool that helps web developers test library functions directly in the browser console. Instead of creating a project and installing packages for every test, you can load various libraries into the window object and use them instantly.

## 🚀 Deployed Site
https://console-kit.zuhno.io

## 🎯 Key Features
- Load multiple libraries into the window object.
- Test library functions directly in the browser's developer console.
- Simplifies setup for quick and efficient testing.

## 🛠️ How to Use
Visit the ConsoleKit site.
Open the browser developer tools and navigate to the Console tab.
Use the loaded libraries via the window object.

```javascript
// e.g. Using Lodash
window.lodash.chunk(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2);
```

## 📚 Included Libraries
The libraries loaded into ConsoleKit can be found either on the site's UI or in this repository's package.json file.

## 🧩 Project Purpose
Web developers often test simple code snippets in the browser console. However, testing libraries typically requires creating a project and installing packages, which can be tedious. ConsoleKit streamlines this process, providing a quick and convenient testing environment.
